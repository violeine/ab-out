## benefit of introducing assignment and hidden state
- easy to encaps _time-vary_ variables
- some of implementation got leak and intertwined with other part of the program 
and this help prevent it
-> easy to encapsulate state and hide implementation
## the cost of introducing assignment
- with assignment operator, our model can not be interpreted in term of _substitution_
  model + no more _math like fn_
	- subtitution based ultimately on the notion that the symbol is the _name_ of the _value_
	- with assignment, symbol is now the _place_ where _value_ can be _store_ and the _value_ can be _changed_
- make thing complicated

### Sameness and change
- a language / program that use substituted model which is "equals can be substituted for equal" in expression without changing the value of the expression is called _referential transparent_
- once we introduce assignment, _referential transparent_ is violated
	- make thing harder to check if its _referential transparent_ or not when substituted expression -> this make our program harder to reason about
- this also make idea about "the same" is harder to understand / not clear

	```scheme
	(define peter-acc (make-account 100)) ;; this is different object vs below
	(define paul-acc (make-account 100))
	```
- this is 2 distinc object, change one don't affect the other 

```scheme
(define peter-acc (make-account 100))
(define paul-acc peter-acc) ; point paul-acc to peter-acc; aliasing; give a new name
```
- 2 name point into same object (`aliasing`)
- if paul change something, peter would know

- as long as we don't do modify/assignment operator, the combound object is stay in the same piece 
  - but after we change with assignment, this view no longer valid. An object now have an "identity" which is _different_ from the piece of which it is composed
  -> this not only affect programming language but our perception about the sameness and identity
  
### imperative programming
- you have to make sure each statement is using the correct order	
	- increment first then assign or vice versa?
